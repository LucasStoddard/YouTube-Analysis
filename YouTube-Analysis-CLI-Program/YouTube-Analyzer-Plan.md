## Program Skeleton and Plan
1. Program requests the user follow the steps for uploading their CSV
2. Once that is finished, break out of that loop and start a new one
3. Make it so the user can request overall feedback. This includes...
    - The metric that is lagging behind the most, and what to do about it
        - A video as well that is well preforming in this metric
    - The other metrics in order of what needs most improvement first
        - Advice for each one of those metrics
    - A simple piece of advice based upon the combination of metrics above/below average 
    - Finally, the best video in terms of all these metrics, recommending that an approach similar to this video as the best way forward.
    - Words of encouragement
